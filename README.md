# PyPoll Challenge 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>

In this Challenge, we are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. 
Given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: 

**"Date"** <br>
**"Profit/Losses"**<br>

## *Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:*

•	Total number of months included in the dataset.<br>
•	The total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period. <br>
•	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes. <br>
•	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period. <br>
•	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period. <br>

In addition, final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
Financial analysis results:


Financial Analysis<br>
----------------------------<br>
Total Months: 86 <br>
Total: $22564198 <br>
Average Change: $-8311.11 <br>
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002) <br>
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558) <br>

## In this Challenge, We are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.<br>

Given a data set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: <br>
"Voter ID"<br> 
"County" <br> 
"Candidate"<br> 

## *Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:* <br>
•	The total number of votes cast <br>
•	A complete list of candidates who received votes.<br>
•	The percentage of votes each candidate won.<br>
•	The total number of votes each candidate won <br>
•	The winner of the election is based on maximum vote Cast.<br>

RESULTS should appear like this:-

Election Results <br>
-------------------------<br>
Total Votes: 369711<br>
-------------------------<br>
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)<br>
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)<br>
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)<br>
