##PYTHON CHALLENGE

![alt text](Starter_Code/Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

In this Challenge, we are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. 
Given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: 

**"Date"** 
**"Profit/Losses"**

## Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

•	Total number of months included in the dataset.
•	The total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
•	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
•	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
•	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
Financial analysis results:
